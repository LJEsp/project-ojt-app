## What is this?
Parousia is an OJT attendance web application meant for company use. This is a project I built with the MERN stack for educational purposes. Much of the basic setup and techniques used in this app are based from Brad Traversy's devconnector project which I learned from one of his courses. This project isn't perfect — lots of mistakes here and there but it was a good learning experience.
